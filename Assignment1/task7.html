        // function. The program should then use nested if-else statements to determine if the
        // person is eligible to vote.
        // First, the program should check if the person is Pakistani or Indian. If they are not, the
        // program should display a message saying they are not eligible to vote.

        // male and over the age of 18, they are eligible to vote. If the person is female and over the
        // age of 18, the program should ask if they are married. If they are married, they are eligible
        // to vote. If they are not married, they are not eligible to vote.
